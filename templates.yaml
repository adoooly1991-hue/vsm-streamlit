  defects:
    high:
      - "At {step_name}, the first-pass yield gap is evident: defects at {defect_pct:.1f}% (>{defect_target:.1f}%). This is driving rework loops and latent WIP between {prev_step} → {step_name}."
    medium:
      - "Defects at {step_name} near the threshold ({defect_pct:.1f}% vs {defect_target:.1f}%). Tighten SPC and error-proofing to prevent drift."
  waiting:
    high:
      - "Queueing in front of {step_name} is significant: estimated waiting {wait_min:.0f} min exceeds cycle time ({ct_sec:.0f} s). This indicates a bottleneck or flow imbalance."
    medium:
      - "Intermittent queues observed before {step_name}; monitor for starved/blocked intervals and re-balance as needed."
  inventory:
    high:
      - "Excess WIP ({wip_units:.0f} units) between {prev_step} and {step_name} ties up cash and space, raising handling risk and aging exposure."
    medium:
      - "WIP buffer ahead of {step_name} exceeds target. Right-size buffer via pull signals and leveled release."
  overproduction:
    high:
      - "{step_name} operates in push mode without a consumption signal, increasing FG/WIP exposure and masking process issues."
    medium:
      - "Push scheduling observed at {step_name}. Introduce pull/CONWIP to align output to takt."
  transportation:
    high:
      - "Material handling intensity is elevated around {step_name} (moves={layout_moves}, distance≈{distance_m} m). Each move adds non-VA time and damage risk."
  motion:
    high:
      - "Operator motion at {step_name} exceeds ergonomic targets (~{walk_m_per_unit} m/unit). Re-layout point-of-use tools and parts to reduce travel."
  overprocessing:
    high:
      - "Non–value-add steps detected at {step_name} (redundant checks/data entry). Streamline to first-time-right checks only."
  talent:
    high:
      - "Non-utilized talent at {step_name}: issues are solved locally without feedback loops; suggestions not institutionalized."
